# Loan Default EDA Case Study
Understanding the risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

  -If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

  -If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

 

The data given below contains the information about the loan application at the time of applying for the loan. It contains two types of scenarios:

  -The client with payment difficulties: he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample,

  -All other cases: All other cases when the payment is paid on time.
